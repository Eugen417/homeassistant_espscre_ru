"""Which way a screen is to hang, standing up or lying down (app 0.4.85, firmware 0.53.0+).

Chosen beside the mockup in the editor, for a screen whose glass is not square: the layout is laid out on the grid of
that way and goes to the screen with it (begin's "upright"), which turns, starts again and keeps the way. Kept here per
Home Assistant device until the screen has it and after, so a screen whose preferences were wiped (a USB flash) is turned
back the next time its layout goes out. A screen nobody turned has no entry: it hangs the way it was built. A choice
keeps the angle its screen's own YAML was built with at the time (LVGL_ROTATION, None for its board's own): a screen
installed again with another way in New screen hangs that way, and the old choice no longer counts.
Kept apart from the saved layouts, whose records an older app reads with a fixed set of fields."""
