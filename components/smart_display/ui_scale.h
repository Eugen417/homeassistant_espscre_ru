// The screen's look and scale (app 0.2.9x, responsive boards).
//
// A screen hangs on a wall and is used from the same distance whatever its size, so every size the firmware
// draws is a physical one. Two looks exist: `standard` (the Guition's sizes at 170 dpi) and `compact` (the CYD's
// at 143 dpi, for glass too small for the standard). A board declares its look and its pixel density
// (DISPLAY_DPI = diagonal pixels / diagonal inches); ui::configure() turns that into one scale for every pixel
// size the C++ carries, so a 7-inch at 133 dpi draws the standard look at 78 % and a 294 dpi panel at 173 %.
// On the CYD and the Guition the scale is exactly 100: their pixels are the reference.
//
// Sizes that come from the board file (the tile grid, TILE_ICON_SIZE, the fonts) are already scaled there; ui::px()
// is for the sizes the C++ decides itself (paddings, key heights, strips), in the reference look's pixels.
