"""What a screen's own override YAML hangs on stays where it is (app 0.2.127+).

Owners change their hardware through Override YAML (docs/EASY_SETUP.md): a package loaded after the board's, that
`!extend`s or `!remove`s a part by its id or sets a substitution. Those overrides live on the owners' own Home Assistant,
where no test of ours can see them, so the ids and names they hang on are a promise: a board may move a part to another
file (ESPHome finds an id wherever it is), but not rename it or take it away. The overrides people shared in GitHub
issues are kept in tests/fixtures/overrides/, one file per board and case; tools/check.sh --firmware has ESPHome read
each of them on its board, and this test keeps what they name.
